    <p> Out of all the animated movies, I see Shrek being the best-animated film not because of it's over the top humor, 
        but for being so well-scripted and improvised which made the movie a lot better. Along with 'Madagascar' and 'The Incredibles', this is one of my favorite animated movies 
        and here's why I think it could be (if not) the best-animated film of all time. Some may argue Shrek 2 is a better sequel, but <i>Shrek (2001)</i> has so many iconic moments we can't forget about. First, there is the iconic intro of Shrek and the amazing use of <i>All-Star</i> by <i>Smash Mouth</i> 
        in the background. It was almost not used in the intro, but I'm glad test audiences loved it and was used in the final cut. Without All-Star in the beginning, the intro would've been boring. Every time I watch Shrek and that intro, 
        it gets me so hyped and interested to watch the movie due to its entertaining tone. Aside from animated musical films, this one could have the best-animated soundtrack.</p>
    <p> There are two key elements that I was inspired by watching this film:</p>
    <p> <b>Friendship:</b> During the movie, I was so impressed by Shrek and Donkey's relationship. Even though they didn't get along when they first met, their relationship grew a lot on their journey to find and rescue Fiona. 
        Shrek might be rude at times to Donkey or Fiona, but what's beautiful is that he learns that being with others is more enjoyable than being alone at the swamp.</p>
    <p> <b>Loving someone, no matter what they look like:</b> Although Beauty and the Beast was the one animated film that debuted that message, Shrek actually made it more entertaining and easier to understand. 
        Fiona might be disgusted at first when she first met Shrek, but she learned to love him not only because Shrek rescued her, but proved to be a gentle giant and had character unlike Farquaad whose only goal was to marry Fiona just to become king and bring tyranny to Duloc. 
        Shrek and Fiona's on-screen chemistry not only showed their respect for each other, but proved that you can still love someone even if they look different and have a great personality. 
        Shrek and Donkey's mockery of Farquaad might seem to contradict the message, but it was used as a way to show what a bad example of not respecting someone's appearance would look like to audiences. 
        This important message does relate to this common habit in the real world and tells us that we should respect a person's personality and not their physical appearance.</p>
    <p> Overall, not only is <i>Shrek (2001)</i> very well scripted and entertaining, it always stayed faithful to its messages and stood out as an amazing film of its own. An animated film is better to watch when it stays true to its message, 
        and <i>Shrek (2001)</i> could be the best-animated film because of its dedication.</p>
